 find the characters who appear the most in the SW movies;
 
I've gotten the SWAPI response as a JsonObject from the query the to get all "people" and the count of the total so created a list to store  the Characters
(class with 2 Strings atributtes)And created a loop to read the total of objects to get each information for add into the list, so i used the Collections.sort
to sort the list so it would be organize where the first character is the one with the most films.
 
 Check how many people have piloted our dear Millennium Falcon and display their names;
 
i've used the API to get all starships and created a loop to get the one with the name equals to Millennium Falcon when found it, i've stored the pilots in a list into a Class called StarShip.


 what was accomplished in the challenge;
 
 I used the SWAPI and Jfreechart to make charts used the bars version to make it horizontal so it could be better visualized and placed the pilots information on a pie chart.
 
 instructions on how to check what was fulfilled;
 
 You can run the main class.
 
 print the images that prove your solutions;
